To use this solution:
1) Download and extract the files.
2) Copy the ToastsShowRelatedKBs folder to the CustomSpace folder on your Cireson portal server
3) Open the Custom.CSS file within the files.
4) Copy all content and paste in to your Custom.CSS file within your CustomSpace folder on your Cireson portal server
5) Open the Custom.js file within the files.
6) Copy all content and paste in to the very top of your Custom.JS file within your CustomSpace folder on your Cireson portal server.

NOTE: The Alertify.js function within the Custom.JS file MUST be at the very top of the Custom.js file.
This is a known issue and not resolved at this time.

NOTE: The ScriptLoader function included in the Custom.JS can be used to move other Custom.JS code out to sub folders and assists with fault finding of many scripts being loaded.
